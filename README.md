Description
===========

The idea of the project was comming last year, when I thought about to
write a game. I thought that the good idea will be to do a controler.
This project isn't only a version 1.0 of the controller, but too a
visual arts project in 13 $_{}^{th}$ on Gymnasium. I tried to do own PCB
platine to get possibility of using more then only 2 +5 and 3 ground
PIN's on arduino. I needed to do won PCB because i musst to connect the
L293D motor driver. With the glove get the user possibility to controll
2 dc-motors and with the buttons can the user stop the motors and choose
new neutral position. For power supply I used 2x3,7V batteries, which
are connected to the Step Up. The most important part of this controller
is the module MPU 6050 / GY-521, which send data about position in x,y,z
axis to the arduino.

All used hardware
=================

-   Arduino uno

-   L239D motor driver

-   2 x batteries 3,7V

-   MT3608 Steup Up

-   GY-521

-   GPIO

-   some cable

Software
========

Future
======

For the future the procject will change his name to:
DC-GlovesController. Most importan changes are in software part, but the
hardware will get too a big changes for example: flexiband, maybe
arduino micro, bluetooth module, the L239D will be not more a part of
the controller. For the software most important change will be in the
algorithms. They will be 2 algorithms which should reduce the disruption
and care abouth better communication and data.
